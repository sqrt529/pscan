pscan  −  A  tiny  portscanner

pscan <‐H Host[,Host2,HostN]> [‐p <Port[‐Port]>] [‐P [N]] [‐o <outfile>]  [‐v]

The  pscan  utility will  scan  ports on a specified host by using the connect() scan method.

The following operands are supported:

	host     The hostname or IP‐Adress which should be scanned.
	
	port     A non‐negative decimal integer  specifying  the  portnumber to scan.


The following options are supported:

         ‐H host  This  option  must  be given. The parameter for
                  this option  is  the  hostname  which  will  be
                  scanned.  (Separated  by  comma, if you want to
                  scan more than one host).



         ‐p port  This option is optional. The parameter for this
                  option  is  a  single port or a portrange to be
                  scanned.



         ‐h       This option is optional and will print the  us‐
                  age message.



         ‐P [N]   This  option is optional. If defined ‐PN, pscan
                  does not ping the host before scanning. If host
                  is  down,  pscan always print out, that the re‐
                  mote port is closed.



         ‐o       This option is optional. If set,  pscan  writes
                  stdout to a file.



         ‐v       This  option is optional and will show the ver‐
                  sion number of pscan.


	Example 1: Scan a hosts full portrange (1 up to 65535)
	example% pscan ‐H hostname

	Example 2: Scan a host with a special port specified
	example% pscan ‐H hostname ‐p 22

	Example 3: Scan different  hosts  with  a  special  port specified
	example% pscan ‐H hostname1,hostname2,hostnameN ‐p 22

	Example  4:  Scan a host with a special portrange specified
	example% pscan ‐H hostname ‐p 22‐79
